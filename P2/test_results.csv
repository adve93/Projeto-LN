"my family and i stayed here while we were visiting chicago. this was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. it was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. the staff was friendly and went the ""extra mile"" to make sure we had everything we needed. the beds were comfortable. we would definitely stay here again.

"warning! my stay at the talbott hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. i was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. after receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the talbott. they were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. and breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to king suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. if someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms i would have sworn we were at motel 6, not a luxury hotel in chicago. the linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. i was truly disgusted. after a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. the next morning i was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. i have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts i have ever eaten. the toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. i would never recommend this as a place to stay. i would suggest the red roof inn over this place anytime.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago while in town for business, and enjoyed my stay very much. i stayed in a room with a king bed, which was very comfortable. the room had all the things i needed for my stay, which was nice. the only thing is i think there was a party on my floor, but they quieted down quickly enough. my room even had an internet connection! i also had dinner one night at the china grill, and it was an amazing meal! overall, i had a great stay, and will return next time i am in chicago.",DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE
"o.m.g best hotel ever ! i've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed , how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room , the best food i've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with queen anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid's stayed here . and it's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs .

"we became an ambassador member just before spending mother's day at the chicago intercontinental, and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room. our saturday night stay was the best $99 we ever spent (mother's day special). the welcoming chocolate covered strawberries began the weekend on a high note; the concierge continued it by arranging a wonderful dinner (moderately priced) , and the great sunday breakfast topped it all off. all in all, mother's day in chicago was super. we loved it enough to be back for labor day weekend (another ""package"").

"we stay at the palmer house when we attend conferences in chicago. it is a stately building. but this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. first, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. the cost is $7.50 per hour. on-line it indicated that hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. many hotels have free wi-fi. wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. they also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. there is no business center in-house for copies, etc. our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. it did not separate us from the bathroom noises. when someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes ""sung"" like old pipes do,but very loudly. an empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. the concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. if you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. the staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. i doubt we'll return....",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
the amalfi hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when i visit chicago. this place really knows how to treat their guests. they serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have ipod docking stations in the room! if you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. i took advantage of the free wi-fi and the plush bathrobes. while i stayed there i had to try the spa services that were offered. wonderful experience! the staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and i will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to chicago. ,DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE
"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago for business, but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it! the accommodations exceeded my expectations. my bed was very comfortable, the room was big enough, and the shower was so relaxing. i had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at j's express. the fitness center was clean, and inspiring. i will recommend this hotel to others while in the area.

"this hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years. the first room they gave us was a shock. tiny and the bathroom was a joke,, you had to step inside, move out of the way just to shut the door. the furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was very beat up and painted over about 100 times. so they transfered us to the 'executive suite' that room had a tiny bathroom.. i mean tiny! the furniture was hideous and dirty. it was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud. the only impressive part is the lobby.. but don't be fooled. because after that .. the floors above look like they need a major overhaul.. and the rooms were not worth even $100 per night. we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through priceline deal. i don't think we want to do priceline again only because they have the knickerbocker as a 4 star hotel and we don't ever want to go back there again. 2 stars at best for the dumpy knickerbocker. they should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms. boomer. naperville, il",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"on a recent stay at the fairmont chicago millemmium park hotel i was appalled at the service i received at such a supposedly high end hotel. when i arrived i had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in. apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with. finally i was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area. much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and i heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight. and the room was obviously a room for smokers. the blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke. i, of course complained, but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but i was welcome to check out and go to another hotel. after a fitfull night's sleep i awoke to children running up and down the hallway. their parents were no where in sight. my shower was cold and had no pressure. i was given two towels one of which had not been laundered. i could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him i would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it. i cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"i loved staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago, not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere, but they give me the option to bring my pet with me. they are a dog friendly hotel, it costs $55.00 a night for the dog to stay with you, but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you. i loved this option. they also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats, food, bowls and doggy clean up bags. i higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel.

"while making the obligatory trip to the chicago area to visit family, we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the hard rock hotel chicago. what a great decision! the rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities. and, according the younger members of the family, ""very cool""! we can't wait to come back.",DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE
"overall the hotel is very nice. the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, but they tend to be aging or dated. my bathroom was particularly below average, with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead. the toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed. the conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant. i hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don't get enough business on their own. breakfast was very good. it's a relatively large european-style spread.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"it's so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website, claiming said deal is available on certain dates. but, when you call to make a reservation based on that deal, they tell you it's not available. there are rooms available, but not the deal. then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal. i get that. then just say that on the website. ""here's a great deal . . . but only a small number of people will actually get it."" so much for the great reviews about service . . . i couldn't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed. bad form, conrad, bad form.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE

"perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. its in an area with plenty of stores ( the mile) and restaurants. hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall i would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. the subway to wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door.

"at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"the room was very spacious with very nice, colorful decorating. the beds felt like lying on a cloud, and there were four pillows on each bed, two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. the bathroom was very nice also. overall, i was very pleased with the stay. you had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. i thought that was a good security issue. it has a great location too, close to downtown. i would recommend it. the decorations were very classy. most hotels have two of the same framed art, boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. the hyatt regency was just the opposite.",TRUTHFULPOSITIVE
"wow! loved the ambassador east hotel in chicago! it was so close to all the great sights of chicago like navy pier, lake michigan, and all the fabulous dining. the hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional, but cozy manner. the entire family loved it, even the dog...because they are also pet friendly at the ambassador east hotel! we loved the restaurant there, the pump room was great, something to please even the pickiest of our eaters. we were there on a family get-away, but asked to see a larger ""suite"". the suites were gorgeous. i can't wait to tell our friends about this place! our next business trip to chicago, we are booking at this hotel. they have the perfect conference rooms and we love the service! we are definitely coming back!",DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE

"i visited the hotel allegro chicago while i was on vacation with my daughter. i booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. i was particularly excited there was a fitness center because i work out on a regular basis and i would not have to give that up on my vacation. let me start by saying the staff was very rude and i was very dissappointed they could not respect that i was very tired after traveling a very long way. i booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at all, despite that fact that i was travelling with a small child as well! they did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she ""didn't know the area"" to tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so i never got to use it. worst hotel experience of my life, i will never go back. - sandy d.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"i have recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel and although i have stayed there a variety of times before, for both business and pleasure, my experience this time was particularly poor. from right when i checked in to the day i left i felt like i was constantly around unfriendly people who didn't want to be at work their to do their jobs. my room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day, and when i was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways, i couldn't sleep. for my next visit to chicago i won't be staying at the hyatt regency.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue, a five minute walk from the orange ""loop"" line that will get you to and from midway airport. forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. on the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. no kidding. the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. on the positive side, however, there were aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. the king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. we had a largish tv with a dvd player. there is a safe and munchies. the gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. it is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. there are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to l2 to get to the gym. this way you dont have to traverse the lobby. the front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. i read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. i got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when i needed it, change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning. the hard rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the water tower, the drury theater, john hancock, and magnificent mile. for those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend gourmet pantry at 155 n. michigan avenue [--]. this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning, no less: $1.99. the hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. we would stay at the hard rock again, and think it is great for people with ""tweens."" not sure about the toddler set, though.

"as others have said, once all the construction works are completed i suspect that the prices this hotel can (legitimately) charge will put it out of our price range. which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel, & the location couldn't be better. the room was very spacious, with separate sitting & study areas & a nice bathroom. only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice. but none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay.

"first let me say, the front office people at hotel monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what i'd hoped. there are some other problems; the furnishings are quite rundown, and housekeeping wasn't very helpful. we booked a suite and the sofa bed, chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use. i've attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. comfortable it was not! the chair bottom is all broken down too. i invited one of the assistant managers to view our furniture, and a slight adjustment was made in our rate. as to housekeeping, we had ordered an in-room coffee service (which kimpton's web site says is there, but you have to specifically request) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee. we had to call the front desk every day. and, housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl. i had requested water be added to the bowl when i noticed it going down and my note was disregarded. these things may not matter to you, but if you plan to spend a week, like we did, you might want to be comfortable. the bedroom and bathroom were superior; just the living room was bad.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"as a former chicagoan, i'm appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago. first of all, i was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which i received. there's an experience designer who is supposed to be like a ""personal concierge,"" but my experience with my ed was terrible. i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to. not only that, but i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. when i finally got to my room, i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. on top of that, the bed was messily done; i could have done a better job on my own bed at home. i was angry at this point, because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi, and i didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. i needed to use the wi-fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. when i finally checked out of the amalfi, i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i'd had with my room and the hotel. i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away!",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"spent three nights in chicago at this property. first of all, i have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the magnificent mile close to terrific restaurants, the art institute and orchestra hall. the hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. the rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. this property needs to be renovated. some observations: the junior suite i had was laid out strangely. a small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. the mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. while descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that i could barely stand up. it stopped on the 11th floor and i was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (this experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. now the good news - the staff is terrific. they make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. i wish they had a better property to work in.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE

"i can easily say this is one of the worst hotels i've stayed at the. the receptionist up front was a snooty, sarcastic teenager or post teenager. you can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. the room was dirty, stains on the carpet, the showerhead was moldy and rusted, the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. the towels had a horrible aroma. the hotel is very narrow, so we were near a construction zone so, i would plan on waking up at 6:am if you choose the talbott. the next day, i asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. that room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. i asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day, if were not out by noon. i had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. please stay away from this hotel, i think a holiday inn would be better. andrew f. gulli",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"this was my first time staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago and i have nothing but hate for the entire experience. the building itself is maintained, however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. and while the outside appearance is fine and dandy, my room 325, was repulsive. as soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip, i noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around, the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement, before i could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. immediately i went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour, a complete waste of time, because as soon as i had reported my problem i was told that no other rooms were available and i would have to make do, they did however say i could stay the night free of charge. the next morning as i was set to leave i decided i would try the breakfast, in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. let me tell you, that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold, the worst breakfast i have ever had in my entire life. overall the employees are arrogant and callous, with the work ethic of a 2 year old child, they cannot cook, the room for me was poorly maintained, however they are good at refunding your money.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"i had really high hopes for this hotel. the location seemed great and the prices were too. unfortunatley, you get what you pay for. despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier, there weren't many other redeeming qualities. the staff was very rude. we arrived late after a long drive from detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in. once we finally got checked in, our room hadn't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people. we were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn't get to it until morning! we had planned on seeing some of chicago's attractions like the field museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go. their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them. finally, when we checked out, they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night. ridiculous!",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights, a thursday through saturday. let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. we chose to stay in the ""king bed deluxe room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. the room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. the major annoyance was how loud people were. we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. you can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. the service was also extremely sub par. we had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. she completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. it scared me and i'm just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing. so to sum up, we will never stay at the conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

while traveling in chicago i stayed at the sofitel on chestnut street. though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. i arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. i reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. i complained that i had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. my complaint was totally disregarded. i was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. when i explained that the noise was bothersome i was treated rudely. the woman at the front desk actually ask me if i thought she could make the workers stop. i understand that the staff has no control over the noise. they did however know about the construction. information i did not have at the time i booked. information that would have swayed my decision. then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. i will not be staying there again.,TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago during labor day weekend, huge mistake! when i got to my room everything seemed okay,until i went into the bathroom. there was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard i turned the knob, it would not stop. there was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. it also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as i saw a wad of hair, and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. i called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. while i was waiting i turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there.... the a.c. started blowing out hot, musky air and had the room smelling horrible. i made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. they told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. i was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip i was hearing i had no choice but to take it. when i moved to the new room, there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later, i was able to relax and settle in. hard rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason, i will not be staying there again.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"the chicago hyatt regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation--ie the room cannot be cancelled. i recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel. the reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy. however, when i tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe, robert, the reservation supervisor, said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room. he said that i should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking / non-refunable. this clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone. i told him to cancel without being charged. in response, he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay. why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? the bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement, and robert should go back to customer service school!",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE

"not worth the price! i had the unfortunate experience of staying in the hilton homewood suites in downtown chicago. i stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. i wish i would have saved my money and went somewhere else. with a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. not a chance. in addition to the $259 price tag, i also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. if i had stayed at the motel 6, parking would have been free. the staff there were not very nice at all. when i registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. she was very rude to me. perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but i doubt it. after i arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and i had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). the rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. i didn't go on vacation to cook though. the television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). i tried logging into facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the ""complimentary"" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. i get a better connection at starbucks. they offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. i've had better food at mcdonald's. the food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. traffic around the hotel was hideous. this hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. there are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. the room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. if you're looking for a hotel in chicago, i'd say save some money and go somewhere else. i've had better stays at the best western and many other hotels that cost less.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. most notably is cleanliness, as although the lobby was very clean, the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways, and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. the furnishings were nice and modern, but with various blemishes upon close inspection. bathroom was relatively clean, with the exception of the shower. view was nice for this particular room, and service was relatively quick. the food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. this time with the glasses which were stained, the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. i will not make the mistake of staying here again.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
"this hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. the amalfi hotel chicago advertises itself as a ""luxury hotel"" located in downtown chicago. since it is in downtown chicago, that means that i had street noises keeping me up most of the night. my view also suffered. they had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! the room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but i can get that in just about any hotel these days. there wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price i paid for the room, i certainly had that expectation. it was a let down.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

i was not pleased with my recent stay at the palmer house hilton. my room was not ready upon my arrival and the room i was given was not what i had requested. i had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. the air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. the room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. i wondered what had happened in the room before i got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. there was no doorman available or a cart so i had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. my room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. they promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk i finally gave up. i had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that i spent to stay there.,DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"overview: --overrated hotel in a premium location. the great: --location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. the good: --inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. the mediocre: --room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --no kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from harry caray's across the street. --free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. pressure is pretty low. --view - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. the bad: --free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. same deal for my iphone. i also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my norton anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --no blackout curtains! i had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). never had this issue in any hotel or motel i've ever stayed at. --noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. i had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --tv had crappy hd signal with out of sync audio on every channel. and the remote was useless. --in room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of fiji water bedside was insulting. don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. summary: --not recommended. looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. rating on yelp is bloated by at a least a star.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE
we live down the block from the hotel. we arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. the floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. i think the ambassador east was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. over the years i had had some visiting groups stay there. i had also eaten there and been to the bar but i had never stayed there myself. the lobby is elegant. the service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. the location is the best residential area in the city (as far as i am concerned -- i live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to north michigan avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the loop ( the main business area) there are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. i paid less than $100 including tax for one night. i am not sure what their regular rates are but i think my deal was the best travel bargain around. ,TRUTHFULPOSITIVE
" we just returned from a relaxing stay at the intercontinental in chicago. i have to say the service was phenomenal! from the maid to the concierge and everyone in between, the staff treated us like royalty. it was quite the treat to feel so special. our room was gorgeous. the view of the city was breathtaking. the luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber. we found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean. my wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while i enjoyed the reliable wi-fi connection. during our stay we dinned in the zest. wow! they offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options. we had to try the famous wiener schnitzel -- it was scrumptious. afterwards, my wife and i shared the chocolate lava cake, can i just say oh that cake is to die for! really the best we ever had. in the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool; followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room. afterwards, a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge. overall, our stay at the intercontinental in chicago was nothing short of fabulous. this luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff. we are looking forward to staying at the intercontinental again, hopeful soon!

"i recently was in chicago on business and chose to stay at the swissotel, chicago. the hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. i would have been better off anywhere else. i was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. i guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. when i made my way to reception, i hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. i had organized an executive suite as i was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. when i proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that i had no reservation. i handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though i had spelled it out for her. she then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. correct me if i am wrong, but this is a step down from the room i had asked for! surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! i said that no, i really needed more space as i would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if i wanted to switch the following evening, i would be welcome to do that. the room was ok, although, again, i was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. i did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! there was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. i did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. the fitness center and pool which i was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when i went up. breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what i would have expected for the money. all in all, i would say your money is better spent elsewhere.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"we stayed at the omni chicago hotel recently and had a great experience! my husband and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown chicago. we are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the omni chicago definitely fit the bill. first of all, the hotel is all suites. we stayed in one of the ""premium suites"". the accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. we used the hypo-allergenic ones, but i believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. we were pleased to find that the tv was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of tvs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. there were actually two tvs in our suite. there were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. the location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the miracle mile, with so much to do practically at the omni's doorstep. i also treated myself to the windy city massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. the masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. it was extremely relaxing and i was so pleased to find out that i could get this at the omni. it was easy for us to see why the omni came so highly recommended. i also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. however, we think our best meal was at the omni's 676 restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and i had the carrot soup and the lake erie silver bass. they had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby art institute of chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. we loved that there were multiple museums so close to the omni! we will be frequent visitors at the omni in the future, where i will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. we are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the omni for a great chicago experience!",DECEPTIVEPOSITIVE

""urban chic"" design does not equal comfort; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. room service is expensive, slow, and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. the hotel features two bars: the cafe des architectes bar, and the simply named le bar. cutesy french names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make! excellent service, fair prices, friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great, none of which you will find at either of these bars. cafe des architectes is also a restaurant, offering ""seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with french roots,"" which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation, coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. pass this one by, if you're looking for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in downtown chicago. the water tower is dry.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"our suite at the knickerbocker are quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. first, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""what do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, i began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. fast forward to this evening. following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. on one hand i appreciated his honesty, but on the other, i truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch tv for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. also, i was alarmed to learn that while i slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. this wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. would i stay here again? maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. yet i've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE

"i was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. but let me begin with the things that i do like about the hotel. first off, it is located my favorite part of chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is chicago's equivalent of manhattan's upper east side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of gap, banana republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, hermes of paris (which warrants a separate mention). i also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. the very reason why i always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. i definitely love the room. while the space issue is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. so we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed and still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my herve and louboutins in. my only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again delaware st is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. i mean, seriously. they don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so i do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that i would be getting from say, a 3000-room vegas hotel. first, i called in to reconfirm my reservation. the lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. first off, she was not able to find my reservation and i was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom i had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). the person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which i agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. but the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1am. as a general rule, i am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. so i really wasn't expecting hotels as small as talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. i placed an order of chicken blt, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) i opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). the bread looked like someone stomped on it, the l and t looked like it was 2 days old, the b was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. it was pathetic room service at its finest. we did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. the whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. we won't be coming back, unfortunately.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"we arrived at 10:30 am on a friday, and they had a room ready for us by 11:30 am, mind you check in is not until 3:00pm. we got our room on priceline for $65.00 per night and stayed 3 nights. we were upgraded - for free - to a suite. i think i was so blown away by that, that i forgot to thank them at check-in! our room was fantastic. it also had a wet bar and a fridge. the bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers. i knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar. the bed and pillows were very comfortable. the room was very clean. every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. we stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room. yes, you could hear people in the hallways, but only because they were rude and were yelling. these were not children, they were adults. i don't know why everyone complains about $48 for parking. this is chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much, some without in/out privledges. we didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club. we tried to eat at the corner bakery but it was too crowded. breakfast at nearby houlihan's had a buffet for $9.99 per person. also the grocery store behind the hotel is great. there is a 7-11 not too far away. i don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. yes, it's a big hotel. if you don't want a busy lobby, don't stay in a 2,000 plus room hotel!! i loved the hotel and would recommend it to anyone. not one problem. wasn't too busy for me. would stay here again in a heartbeat.

"the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine, and the website is pretty, but the reality is an over-hyped, overpriced, reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package. the catering they offer is a joke; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area. while the rooms were cleaner than most, there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses, and when i called to complain about it, a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. the rooms look small but cozy when you book online, but when you get there in person, you realize just how tiny they are. trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed, which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. in fact, it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small; you'd get better prices and a far better room from the hilton.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
"i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-march and was so disappointed with everything. the room was small, the carpets in the looby were smelly, no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows. not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days. it costs $10/day to connect to internet. if you want to use internet in the lobby, minimum charge is $5 per use. to use the phone in the rooms for local calls, it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. even the local calls are charged, what a rip off!!! every hotel i have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast, of course no such thing at this hotel. no indoor pool, go figure. i won this from bidding process at priceline, i will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future.",TRUTHFULNEGATIVE

"this was our second time staying here. we were very much looking forward to our weekend at the amalfi (based on how well the first stay was). it turned out better than our anticipation. the beds are very comfortable. 2 headed showers with a large bathroom. the hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out. our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout. then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit, pastries, juice and coffee on our floor (breakfast is on every floor). no great view from our room, but i don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors. we didn't need to drive, take a cab or jump on the l the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. we easily walked to bars, blues clubs, restaurants, the hancock tower, the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. the highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats, cheeses, peppers, and breads. this ran from 5:30 to 7:00, and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. this alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. and an extra money-saving tip...park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on kinzie. its $24 per night during the week and only $6 per night on the weekends. i think the hotel charges $30 to $40 per night to park.

"i'd expect a ""luxury"" hotel to pay more attention to details. the room really hadn't been thoroughly cleaned-- i found hairballs under the bed, the mirrors were streaked, etc. the desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when i was checking in; three of them, two on the phone, and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes. then, they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood; you'd think they'd know where to find a starbucks. the internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days i was there.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"i'll keep it short. my wife, daughter and i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. we go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. location: it is located in the center of the magnificent mile (michigan ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. hotel: the hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (i think they missed a night). service: every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. they always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). they always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. there was no shortage of people to ask things. my only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. they shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. other: we had breakfast in the 676 restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. they even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. the pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. it was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. pool and changing areas were spotless. room: clean, sunny and spacious. probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 tvs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. the windows open for some fresh air. pillows were pretty comfortable. with all aspects considered, i think this was an unbeatable value! i would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. i truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. it was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. the airlines have cornered the market on that.

"the amalfi hotel in chicago advertises itself as family friendly, yet when i arrived with my children it was anything but family friendly. the staff seemed miffed and stuck up, and i had to wait for the personal check in. i was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while i waited, and other guests (all single or couples without children) seemed annoyed every time i passed with my kids while i was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. this might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two, even though it is advertised as such. i give you a great big thumbs down for false advertising, amalfi.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for 3 nights. i must say, i was not impressed. this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. to start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style. the room was ok i suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it. the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. it is simply not worth it.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE

"during my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel in chicago,illinois, at one of their deluxe suites. unfortunately, and i think i speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. the hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. when one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. first of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. for people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. for these, as well as other similar reasons, i would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations.",DECEPTIVENEGATIVE
