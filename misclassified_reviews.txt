Review: the hilton hotel helped us make the most of our trip to chicago. not only are they centrally located near most of chi towns hot spots, but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. the hilton is very classy with their accommodations. i will be returning at my earliest convenience, be it for business or pleasure.

Review: the ambassador east is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the gold coast. unfortunately, i saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. while the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room i was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. it looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. the room also smelled of must or mildew. while the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. i was only here for a single night, but had i been here for anywhere longer i would have requested a refund. please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. the hampton inn and hilton garden inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay.

Review: my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel last month for my son's wedding. when we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to valet our car. after waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip, which i found rude. after finally getting to our room i noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom. i was extremely disappointed with the room and the service. i will not recommend this place to anyone.

Review: this hotel was full of drunks. the lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy. there were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night, yelling in the hallways, making lots of noise. the staff had little to say. i wasn't aware of the noise level when i booked the room and when i threatened to make other reservations, the people in the lobby had nothing to say. we asked for a water view and got a city view. again, the people at the front desk weren't accomodating at all. overall, we had a horrible experience.

Review: while traveling in chicago i stayed at the sofitel on chestnut street. though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. i arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. i reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. i complained that i had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. my complaint was totally disregarded. i was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. when i explained that the noise was bothersome i was treated rudely. the woman at the front desk actually ask me if i thought she could make the workers stop. i understand that the staff has no control over the noise. they did however know about the construction. information i did not have at the time i booked. information that would have swayed my decision. then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. i will not be staying there again.

Review: my stay at the palmer house hilton was wonderful. i was attracted to this hotel because it was going to be me and my finance's first time in chicago. the location of the hotel was perfectly placed downtown chicago we took advantage of the hilton bed and breakfast special. upon check in on friday afternoon we went to the lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend. we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a king size bed. the hotel was spotless. i have never been in a hotel room that was so clean. the portions of food was perfect, and everything they provided was on point. i would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit chicago for the first time. the staff is professional, and let you feel like a king and queen.

Review: we stayed at the fairmont two nights for the sofa art fair at the navy pier. i was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. everyone smiled and welcomed us. the lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the navy pier and the lake. we did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. after waiting an hour, we went to bed. the next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. the hotel is convenient to millenium park and michigan ave. we would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates.

Review: it has been a couple of years since i stayed here, and got it for a night last weekend on hotwire. i paid only $100 and stayed a saturday night. i was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. the lobby has always been great, but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. not any more, as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. the location is still amazing, and with the berghoff open again, there is a great restaurant within walking distance.

Review: i made reservations with the chicago fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in june. i received no written confirmation with cancelation policy, etc. however, when i attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night's reservation, i was told that they would charge me for one nights stay. they have a "3pm the day before your first nights stay" policy. even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy. this is not a common policy on michigan ave. i'd advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy. it was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel!

Review: i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for 3 nights. i must say, i was not impressed. this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. to start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style. the room was ok i suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it. the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. it is simply not worth it.

Review: just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the swissotel chicago is the one for you. my wife and i went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door, this year there is a loud construction site next door. so 8 am saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. i am sure once the summer in chicago comes around they will work all night. just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the navy pier. now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. on top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. the front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. the protestors were there because the swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. if you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. i am sure the swissotel does not want word getting out about this. if you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.

Review: my parents booked five nights at the james for its location and good reviews. they had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. they sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. at my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. the hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. don't book this hotel in the summer. and by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.

Review: i was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. but let me begin with the things that i do like about the hotel. first off, it is located my favorite part of chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is chicago's equivalent of manhattan's upper east side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of gap, banana republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, hermes of paris (which warrants a separate mention). i also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. the very reason why i always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. i definitely love the room. while the space issue is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. so we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed and still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my herve and louboutins in. my only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again delaware st is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. i mean, seriously. they don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so i do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that i would be getting from say, a 3000-room vegas hotel. first, i called in to reconfirm my reservation. the lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. first off, she was not able to find my reservation and i was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom i had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). the person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which i agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. but the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1am. as a general rule, i am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. so i really wasn't expecting hotels as small as talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. i placed an order of chicken blt, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) i opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). the bread looked like someone stomped on it, the l and t looked like it was 2 days old, the b was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. it was pathetic room service at its finest. we did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. the whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. we won't be coming back, unfortunately.

Review: overall the hotel is very nice. the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, but they tend to be aging or dated. my bathroom was particularly below average, with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead. the toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed. the conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant. i hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don't get enough business on their own. breakfast was very good. it's a relatively large european-style spread.

Review: this hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. the amalfi hotel chicago advertises itself as a "luxury hotel" located in downtown chicago. since it is in downtown chicago, that means that i had street noises keeping me up most of the night. my view also suffered. they had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! the room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but i can get that in just about any hotel these days. there wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price i paid for the room, i certainly had that expectation. it was a let down.

Review: i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a $129 rate on travelzoo and figured i'd save my company some money. i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor. i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november. when i arrived in chicago at 7:30pm i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told "no problem." when i arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm i was told they didn't have a room for me and that i'd have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for. it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away. i was told that they overbooked and didn't get as many cancellations as they expected. i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience. i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room! the "experience designers" were great and very helpful. the rooms were very nice and comfortable (felt like home). the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the "healthy factor." it was nice that they did have fruit. i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel--they just need to get the basics down!

Review: hotel monaco is in a really great location, only a block away from the miracle mile and a couple of blocks from millenium park. sears tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to greek town and lincoln park (we did). the daily, complimentary, wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. if you can, leave your car behind, you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey, which is not very surprising considering the location. everything was clean, fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. the only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around "the loop" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning.

Review: this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue, a five minute walk from the orange "loop" line that will get you to and from midway airport. forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. on the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. no kidding. the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. on the positive side, however, there were aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. the king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. we had a largish tv with a dvd player. there is a safe and munchies. the gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. it is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. there are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to l2 to get to the gym. this way you dont have to traverse the lobby. the front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. i read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. i got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when i needed it, change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning. the hard rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the water tower, the drury theater, john hancock, and magnificent mile. for those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend gourmet pantry at 155 n. michigan avenue [--]. this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning, no less: $1.99. the hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. we would stay at the hard rock again, and think it is great for people with "tweens." not sure about the toddler set, though.
